📝 Project Overview
This project focuses on building an efficient language detection system using machine learning. It predicts the language of any given sentence based on patterns learned from a labeled multilingual dataset.

Language identification is a critical task in many global applications including:

Translation engines

Chatbots

Social media moderation

Customer support routing

The dataset contains over 20 different languages and the model is trained to classify text samples into their respective languages using supervised learning.

📂 Dataset Description
Source: Kaggle (or other open-source corpus)

Column Name	Description
Text	The sentence or phrase to classify
Language	The actual language label

Languages Included: English, French, Spanish, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, and more.

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas and NumPy – data manipulation

Scikit-learn – ML models and pipeline

TfidfVectorizer – feature extraction

Multinomial Naive Bayes – classification model

Matplotlib / Seaborn – visualization

🔁 Project Workflow

Edit
1. Import Required Libraries
2. Load and Explore the Dataset
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Feature Extraction using TF-IDF
5. Train-Test Split
6. Train Classification Model (Naive Bayes)
7. Evaluate Model Performance
8. Predict Language for New Text
✅ Key Results
Achieved high accuracy (over 95%) on validation set.

TF-IDF helped capture important n-gram patterns for different languages.

Successfully detected 20+ languages with simple classical ML models.

📈 Future Improvements
Use deep learning models (LSTM / BERT) for better contextual accuracy.

Add language confidence scores.

Deploy the model using Flask/Streamlit for real-time language detection.
